Makefile:
If you compiling your system on a uio computer use make, make debug. 
If your system is like mine, where ws and ps is not placed as on a uio computer
you can compile this file with make arch if its correct. Else you can just change 
the path.

Other:
sorry for very messy code. didn't got time to split it naturaly up in differnt files and headers.
