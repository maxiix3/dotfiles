Maxiix3 does Dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles from my archsetup, my first linux setup started november 2014 and still updating with different programs ect.

I use gnu stow to manage my dotfiles. To install and make symlinks install stow,
  enter the dotfiles folder and use the command
  """
  stow <foldername>
  """
